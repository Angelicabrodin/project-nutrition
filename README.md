# Project 16. Nutrition-App, build during Technigo Bootcamp Spring 2020!

## 1. What is this?

In this week's project, we used React Redux to build a Nutrition application that fetches data from an open API using the camera on the computer that scans the barcode of a product to retrieve further information. 

## 2. What did I do?
In this project we are using a function that uses the camera to scan barcodes from different products. So the first thing I did was to set everything up to be sure that the scanning actually works. After that I made the fetch to the Open world facts api so that you are able to scan a barcode and retrieve information based on the variables that you put in. When I was sure that it was fetching correctly I started sorting the different components based on how I wanted the App to look. I decided to make an "easy" fetch just retrieving the name of the product, an image and nutrition grade. And then styling it accordingly. 

I decided to use styled components in this project, to practice it further. And the Api-call is made using a thunk, so that it is re-usable in all the components troughout the project. 



## 3. Where can you see it in action?
